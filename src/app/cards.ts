You will also see any cards they are entitled to see due to card rules; for example you can look at cards they have set aside with Native Village (from Dominion: Seaside).</li><li>You make all decisions for the Possessed player, including what cards to play, decisions those cards provide, and what cards to buy.</li><li>Any cards the Possessed player would have gained in any way, you gain instead; this includes cards bought, as well as cards gained due to Actions.

You do not get any other tokens that player would have gotten (this is a change from the errata in Dominion: Empires). <img src="assets/Debt.png"> is something from Dominion: Empires; if you do not have those cards, that part of Possession’s effects does not matter.</li><li>During the Possessed turn, whenever one of that player’s cards is trashed, set it aside, and that player puts it into their discard pile at the end of the turn, after Clean-up. The card is still trashed, so for example you could have them trash a Mining Village (from Dominion: Intrigue) and get the +<img src="assets/Coin2.png">. Getting those cards back at end of turn does not count as those cards being gained (so for example, you will not get them). Other players’ cards that are trashed during that turn are not returned.</li><li>Cards passed with Masquerade (from Dominion: Intrigue) are not being gained or trashed. Exchanging a card (such as Soldier from Adventures) does not count as gaining or trashing. Cards returned to the Supply, such as with Ambassador (from Dominion: Seaside) are also not being trashed, and so return to the Supply normally.</li><li>If you make another player play an Attack via Possession, that Attack will hit you like it would normally. If you want to use a Reaction in response to that Attack (such as Moat), you would be the one revealing the Reaction, not the player being Possessed.</li><li>Possession causes an extra turn to be played, like the card Outpost does (from Dominion: Seaside). The extra turn happens only after this turn is completely over - you will have discarded everything and drawn your next hand. Outpost only prevents itself from giving a player two consecutive turns, it does not prevent other cards or the rules from doing so. So for example if you play Possession in a two-player game, then after the Possession turn, that player still gets their normal turn. If they played Outpost during that turn though, it would not give them an extra turn (unless another player took a turn in between, such as via another Possession). If you play both Outpost and Possession in the same turn, the Outpost turn happens first. If you make someone play Outpost during a turn in which you Possessed them, that player will get the extra turn and make decisions during it and so forth, not you; if you make someone play Possession during a turn in which you Possessed them, that will make that player Possess the player to their left, rather than you getting to Possess anyone further. Possession turns (and other extra turns) do not count for the tiebreaker. Once the game ends, no further turns are played, including extra turns from Possession and Outpost.</li><li>Unlike Outpost, Possession is not a Duration card. It is discarded in the Clean-up phase of the turn you played it.</li><li>Possession is cumulative; if you play it twice in one turn, there will be two extra turns after this one.</li></ul>Possession is not an Attack, and cannot be blocked by cards like Moat.<br>In a 2-player game, if you have your opponent play Possession while you’re Possessing their deck, then at the end of this turn, they will control a turn with your deck, and then will play their turn as normal. If you play 2 Possessions, then tell the Possessed player to play a Possession of their own during the first Possessed turn, you finish all Possessed turns of the current Possessed player before moving on to the next player’s Possessed turns. Then the first Possessed player finally takes their normal turn. Extra turns happen in turn order. If you play multiple Possessions, then tell the Possessed player to play an Outpost or buy a Mission during the first Possession turn, they get to decide whether the next Possession turns happen first, or the Outpost/Mission turn, since Possession does not give control between turns. If you were Possessed before your regular turn, playing an Outpost or buying a Mission on your regular turn will not give you an extra turn. Cards that are trashed and set aside on a Possession turn are not in the trash for the rest of the turn. This means that they can’t be gained with Graverobber or Rogue, they can’t be played by Necromancer, and they won’t contribute to the value of Forager. A trashed Fortress can be set aside like any other trashed card, at which point it loses track of itself and is not returned to the owner’s hand.',

Watchtower’s topdecking happens after the gain happens; the card still visits the discard pile, or whatever location it was gained to. Watchtower’s topdecking has the same timing as on-gain effects, so for example you could choose to topdeck Death Cart before gaining the 2 Ruins.',

As such, bonus tokens on Band of Misfits do give their effect when Band of Misfits is played, since token effects happen before anything else a card does. If there are any bonus tokens on the card Band of Misfits is emulating, those effects occur as well, after the effects from tokens on Band of Misfits. If Band of Misfits is multiplied when tokens are on its pile (and there’s a card for it to emulate), the token effect on Band of Misfits happens only once, since Band of Misfits is only being played once; once it has been played, it is a different card. However, tokens on a card Band of Misfits is emulating do have their effects multiplied. For example, if the +1 Card token is on Band of Misfits and the +<img src="assets/Coin1.png"> token is on Chapel, and you Throne Room a Band of Misfits, emulating Chapel, you would first get +1 Card, then +<img src="assets/Coin2.png">.<br>If you use Throne Room on Band of Misfits, choosing to play Band of Misfits as a self-trashing card (for example, Embargo), the Band of Misfits will be in the trash after the first play as Embargo, meaning it has left play. Throne Room then plays Band of Misfits again (getting token effects again, if there are any), allowing you to make a new choice as to what Band of Misfits should emulate. However, since Band of Misfits is in the trash, you will only get the on-play effects of the emulated card. Similar logic applies to one-shots that do not trash themselves, but still leave play, such as Island, as well as the case where there are no non-empty Action supply piles cheap enough for Band of Misfits to copy. Under this ruling, it is possible for a multiplied Band of Misfits to trash itself (emulating any trashing one-shot), then gain itself back out of the trash (emulating Lurker, or etc.). Along a similar vein, playing Procession on Band of Misfits, choosing Fortress, would allow you to play the same Band of Misfits again afterwards, since it returned to your hand.<br>If you Procession a Band of Misfits, you will gain a <img src="assets/Coin6.png"> Action, since Band of Misfits will be in the trash (and thus cost <img src="assets/Coin5.png">, since it has left play) when Procession checks its cost.<br>Band of Misfits does not play well with Reserve cards. If you play Band of Misfits as a Reserve card it goes to your Tavern mat and stays there; you can’t call it or otherwise recover it because it is now out of your play area and no longer has the abilities of the card it was imitating. Similarly, a Band of Misfits set aside as an Island will not provide any <img src="assets/VP.png">.<br>Effects that care about card names (such as Pilgrimage) will not register Band of Misfits as a Band of Misfits when it is in play, but as whatever it is emulating. The only exceptions to this are if Band of Misfits were affected by Enchantress, and thus prevented from emulating anything, or if there were no valid emulation targets in the Supply.',

It can be helpful to turn the affected card sideways, to remember that it did not do what it normally does. Enchantress does not affect card abilities from cards played on previous turns; for example if an opponent plays Enchantress and you have an Archive out from a previous turn, on your turn you will first get a card from your Archive as normal, and then the first Action card actually played on that turn will be affected by Enchantress.
