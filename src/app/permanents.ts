		help: 'You can only buy this once per game. When you do, set aside a non-Victory Action card from the Supply that costs up to <img src="assets/Coin4.png">, and put your Estate token on it (the one depicting a house). This is not gaining a card, and does not count for things that care about gaining, such as Treasure Hunter; however at the end of the game, include the card in your deck when scoring. For the rest of the game, all of your Estates have the abilities and types of the set aside card. For example if you set aside a Port, then your Estates are Action - Victory cards, that can be played for +1 Card +2 Actions. This also changes Estates you buy or otherwise gain during the game; if you used Inheritance on a Port and then later bought an Estate, that Estate would come with a Port, just as buying a Port gains you a Port. This only affects your own Estates, not Estates of other players. An Estate is yours if either it started in your deck, or you gained it or bought it, or you were passed it with Masquerade (from Intrigue). An Estate stops being yours if you trash it, return it to the Supply, pass it with Masquerade, or are stopped from gaining it due to Possession (from Alchemy) or Trader (from Hinterlands). There are no limits on the set aside card other than being a non-Victory Action from the Supply costing up to <img src="assets/Coin4.png">; it may be a Duration card, a Reaction card, and so on. It does not have to continue costing up to <img src="assets/Coin4.png">, it only has to cost up to <img src="assets/Coin4.png"> when set aside. Your Estates are still worth 1<img src="assets/VP.png"> when scoring at the end of the game. Your Estates only copy abilities and types; they do not copy cost, name, or what pile they are from (thus they don’t trigger tokens like +1 Action on the copied pile, and are not the Bane for Young Witch from Cornucopia even if the copied pile is the Bane). Starting Estates come from the Estates pile.<br>If you Transmute an Inherited Estate, the Estate is in the trash and, thus, no longer yours when Transmute checks its type; therefore you would only get a Gold (for trashing a Victory card) and not a Duchy (since Estate cannot be an Action card in the trash). The same logic applies to when you Catapult an Inherited Estate, and thus when Catapulting an Estate Inheriting Crown, the other players do not discard down to 3, or gain a Curse. In contrast, if you Ironworks an Inherited Estate, you would get +1 Card and +1 Action. The fact that Estate inherits the abilities but not the name or cost of another card can lead to some surprising effects; as always, reading the text of the card carefully should resolve most confusions. Some examples:<br>If Estate inherits Treasure Map, then when you play an Estate, you trash it and a Treasure Map from your hand (not an Estate from your hand), but you don’t gain Gold because you didn’t “trash two Treasure Maps”.<br>If Estate inherits Crossroads, then playing an Estate can’t give you +3 Actions because it’s not “the first time you played a Crossroads this turn”. But if you play an Estate and then a Crossroads, you do get the +3 Actions from the Crossroads, since it is the first time you’ve played a Crossroads.<br>If Estate inherits Rats, then when you play Estate, you can trash another Estate (but not a Rats), and you gain an actual Rats, and not another Estate.<br>If Estate inherits Catacombs, then when you trash an Estate you must gain a card costing less than Estate, not just less than Catacombs.<br>The exception to the above, as usual, is when Estate inherits Pirate Ship: despite the wording on the Pirate Ship card, coin tokens placed on your Pirate Ship mat by playing Estate count toward the future value of your Pirate Ships (and Estates) in the same way as coin tokens placed by playing Pirate Ship itself.<br>If an Estate comes into your possession via a means not explicitly described in the Official FAQ, such as being put in your hand after being trashed as a Fortress, it is still “yours”, and still has its Inherited properties. Since Inherited Estates are not Actions until they are yours, they cannot be gained by abilities that specify gaining an Action, such as by University. Inherited Estates do count for Vineyard. Estates become yours upon the act of buying, therefore an Estate inherited as a Grand Market can be bought with Copper in play. Buying an Estate does trigger any on-buy effects of the set-aside card, e.g. if you inherited Noble Brigand, it triggers the “attack”. The Estate pile is not yours, and thus not an Action pile; it cannot have Adventures tokens put on it, and cannot be emulated by Band of Misfits or Overlord. Your Estates only look at the text of the set aside card, and do not care if there are Adventures tokens on the pile it is from. Estates Inherited as Gathering cards put <img src="assets/VP.png"> tokens on the pile they Inherited from, not the Estate pile. If you Inherit Fortress, you will not put Estates into your hand if you trash them with Salt the Earth, as Estates in the Supply are not yours.',

		help: 'When you buy this, you gain an Action card costing up to <img src="assets/Coin4.png"> from the Supply and set it aside face up. If you did set it aside, then at the start of your next turn, play that Action card. This doesn’t use up your default Action for the turn. In order to remember to play the card on your next turn, you may want to turn it sideways or diagonally, turning it right side up when you play it. If you move the Action card after you gain it but before you set it aside (e.g. by putting it on top of your deck with Watchtower, from Dominion: Prosperity), then Summon will “lose track” of it and be unable to set it aside; in that case you will not play it at the start of your next turn. If you use Summon to gain a Nomad Camp (from Dominion: Hinterlands), Summon will know to find the Nomad Camp on your deck, so you will set it aside in that case (unless you have moved it elsewhere via another ability). The Summoned card is discarded during your Clean-up phase once its effects are resolved like a typical Action card, as it has been brought into play by the effect of Summon. Summoning a card that gains other cards when gained (such as Border Village or Death Cart) will cause the Summoned card to not be set aside, and thus not played at the start of your next turn. This is because the extra cards gained cover up the Summoned card in the discard pile (since the Summoned card is not set aside immediately), causing the Summoned card to be lost track of. This can still be the right move, however, if the card is Embargoed or under a Contraband. If you are being Possessed, and the player to your right tells you to Summon a card, they gain the card, which does not get set aside, nor played at the start of their turn, instead staying in their discard pile. If you reveal a Trader after Summoning a card, the Silver you gain is not set aside, but stays in your discard pile. If you Summon a Hireling, you will draw a card when you play it, since it will still be the start of your turn.',
